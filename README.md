# 👋 Hi, I’m @AudeNec

### Looking for opportunities

👀 With solid skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React through **fullstack web development training**, I combine technical abilities with a background in project management. My experience in the cultural sector and social economy enables me to bridge technical execution with effective project coordination.

<!-- 🌱 I'm currently learning Express. -->
🧩 On my free time, I like video games, crafts (sewing, etc), puzzle and going out with my friends 🍻
